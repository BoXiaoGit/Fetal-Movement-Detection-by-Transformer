# Fetal-Movement-Detection-by-Transformer
This project uses a transformer-based AI model to detect fetal movements in the womb.


This system is designed to process and analyze fetal movement data collected from sensors, align it with ultrasound-annotated ground truths, and use a machine learning model to classify different types of fetal movements. It includes scripts for data extraction, processing, and classification using a transformer-based architecture.

Data Structure and Collection:

Sensor Data (CSV File): Captures a range of physiological signals via sensors attached to the mother's abdomen, including piezoelectric sensors, mechanomyography sensors, and accelerometers. These sensors provide detailed information on muscle movements and general activity.
Annotations Data (Excel File): Annotations from medical professionals, categorizing movements based on ultrasound observations, are provided with precise timestamps. This helps in correlating observed movements with sensor data for accurate analysis.
Data Processing:

The system begins by loading the raw sensor data and the corresponding annotations. It processes these data to align timestamps and categorizes them based on the type of movement, creating a structured dataset that integrates both sensor readings and medical annotations.
Data is normalized and formatted to ensure compatibility with machine learning models, focusing on maintaining a clean and informative dataset suitable for advanced analyses.
Machine Learning Model:

The classification is performed using a transformer model, which is particularly suited for handling sequential data. This model leverages self-attention mechanisms to understand the temporal dependencies within the sensor data.
It is configured to classify data into categories reflecting different fetal movements as determined by the annotations. The model trains on processed data and validates its accuracy against a testing set, optimizing its parameters to improve classification outcomes.
Training and Evaluation:

Training involves multiple epochs where the model learns to minimize errors and improve its predictive accuracy. The system evaluates the model using standard metrics like loss and accuracy, and outputs a confusion matrix to provide a detailed view of the model's performance across different classes.
Results from the model are used to assess its capability in accurately classifying fetal movements, with an emphasis on understanding and potentially predicting fetal health conditions.
Implications and Usage:

This system can be a valuable tool for researchers and clinicians interested in fetal behavior and health. By providing a detailed analysis of fetal movements and classifying them based on medically annotated ground truths, it aids in enhancing the understanding of fetal well-being.
The insights generated by this system could lead to improvements in prenatal care and interventions, offering a deeper understanding of fetal activity patterns through non-invasive monitoring techniques.
